# employee_recordsystem

This software is built to handle the records of employees of any company. It will help companies to 
keep track of all the employeesâ€™ records in a file.
The provided code is a C program for managing employee records using a console-based interface. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding, listing, modifying, and deleting employee records stored in a file named "rec.txt." Here's a summary of the code:

1. **Global Variables**: The code defines several global variables, including `COORD` for console cursor positioning and file pointers for input and output operations.

2. **`gotoxy` Function**: This function is used to position the cursor at a specified location within the console window. It is often used to create a user-friendly interface.

3. **Main Function**: The `main` function is where the program execution begins.

4. **File Handling**: The code uses file handling to read and write employee records. It checks if the "rec.txt" file exists and opens it in read-write binary mode. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new one.

5. **Employee Structure**: The program defines a structure called `emp` to represent an employee. It includes fields for the employee's name, age, and basic salary.

6. **Menu Interface**: The program displays a menu interface with the following options:
   - Add Record: Allows users to add new employee records.
   - List Records: Displays all existing employee records.
   - Modify Records: Lets users edit existing employee records.
   - Delete Records: Allows users to delete employee records.
   - Exit: Exits the program.

7. **Menu Processing**: Depending on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding operation:
   - Adding records: Users can input employee information, and the program writes it to the file.
   - Listing records: The program reads and displays all existing employee records.
   - Modifying records: Users can search for a specific employee by name and update their information.
   - Deleting records: Users can delete a specific employee's record by name.

8. **File Manipulation**: The code uses various file functions like `fseek`, `fwrite`, and `fread` to manipulate the employee records within the "rec.txt" file.

9. **Loop**: The program runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit.

10. **Cleanup**: The code closes the file when the user chooses to exit the program.

It's worth noting that this code does not include comprehensive error handling and may not be suitable for a production environment. It is intended as a simple demonstration of file handling and console-based user interaction in C. Real-world applications would require more robust error handling and data validation.
